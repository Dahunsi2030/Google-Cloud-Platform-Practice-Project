# LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine
# Objectives: 
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

	* Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

	* Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

	* Connect between the two instances.

Steps:

1. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-1" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default" --tags http

gcloud compute firewall-rules create accept-http --action=ACCEPT --destination=INGRESS --rules=http:80 --target-tags=http

2. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
Choose a zone from the output of this zone and use the grep command to filter the result to list the zones associated with the "us-central1"
gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"

3. Connect between two VM instances.
	a. Connect to my-vm-2:
	    gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
	   - Once it opens ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2 (four times):
	    ping -c 4 my-vm-1
	   - Now use the ssh command to open a command prompton my-vm-1 fro my-vm-2:
	    ssh my-vm-1
	   - Now install the Nginx web server:
	    sudo apt-get install-light -y
	   - Add a custom message to the home page of the web server with the nano text editor:
	    sudo nano /var/www/html/index-debian.html
	   - Change YOUR_NAME to your name on <h2> tag with the use of arrow keys to move the cursor as well like this:
	    Hi from Afe Segun.
	   - Exit the editor and confirm that the web server is hosting your new page. On my-vm-1, execute this command:
	    curl http://localhost/

	--Result: The response will be output of the HTML source code on the web server's home page whereby <h2> custom line text will show.
	   To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
	    exit
	   To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
	    curl http://my-vm-1/
		- Result: The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
	b. Copy the external IP of the my-vm-1 instance from this command:
	    gcloud compute instances list
	c. Paste it into a web browser and press Enter.
		- Result: The response will still be the output of the HTML source code on the web server's home page whereby <h2> custom line text will show.
